## ðŸ“¥ Installation

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file and configure it:
   ```env
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   EMAIL_SERVICE=your_email_service (optional)
   EMAIL_USER=your_email_address
   EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
   ```
4. Run the server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file if needed for API URLs:
   ```env
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## ðŸ“¦ Deployment

- Frontend can be deployed on platforms like Vercel.
- Backend can be deployed using Render, Heroku, or any cloud service.
- Ensure proper CORS settings and environment variables are secured.

## ðŸ”‘ Security Considerations

- Protect sensitive routes with JWT authentication.
- Validate user inputs both on frontend and backend.
- Use environment variables to store secrets and database credentials.

## ðŸ“‚ Future Improvements

- Add role-based access control (student vs admin vs company)
- Implement job search and filtering
- Integrate payment or subscription models
- Enhance UI/UX and mobile responsiveness
